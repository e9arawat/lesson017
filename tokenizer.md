1. It should be mentioned that the prefix and suffix are case-sensitive or not. 

2. It should be mentioned that if we want to find the full word or just the string between prefix and suffix. For example if there a word **momento** in the string and the prefix is **m** and the     suffix is **o**. So do we have to return the full word **momento** or do we have to return two seperate words **mo** and **mento** or just **mo**.

3. It should be mentioned if the token containing the prefix and suffix as subsets should be returned or not.
